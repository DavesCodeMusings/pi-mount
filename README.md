# pi-mount
A simple mounting system for Raspberry Pi 2, 3, and 4.

## What is it?
A picture is worth a thousand words, so have a look at a [3D drawing](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/pi-mount/blob/main/SimplePiMount.pdf) of the part.

## Why?
I designed this so I could attach a Pi to the piece of 1/2" wall-mounted plywood I have holding all my other networking gear. It's cheaper than an official case. It also allows easier access to the SD card and provides open air cooling.

## How do I use it?
Import the [.STL file](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/pi-mount/blob/main/SimplePiMount-Body.stl) into your slicer and send to your 3D printer.

1. Print two copies of the part.
2. Snap one onto the side with the GPIO header, aligning it parallel with the header. The mounting lug should be positioned closest to the SD card end of the Pi.
3. Snap the other onto the side with the power and video connectors. The mounting lug should be positioned between the HDMI and composite video ports.
4. Use a pair of 3mm pan head screws or push rivets inserted through the mounting lugs to secure the Pi. Alternatively, use glue along the base of the mount.
